# Changelog

All notable changes to the Canon Astro Image plugin are documented here.

## 1.5.0.0
- Added Homepage and Changelog links to the plugin's info page in NINA

## 1.4.0.0
- **Fixed**: Auto-delete CR3/CR2 now correctly deletes the Canon RAW file when filename contains temperature or other metadata tokens
- Root cause: FITS file was saved before camera temperature was available, producing a different filename than the CR3 saved by NINA; deletion was using the FITS-derived path instead of the actual CR3 path

## 1.3.0.0
- **Fixed**: Image history now correctly shows FITS/XISF/TIFF path when auto-delete is enabled
- Implementation: Event handler reordering via reflection ensures plugin runs before NINA's history handler
- Conditional redirect: Only applies when "auto-delete Canon RAW" toggle is ON
- Removed unnecessary diagnostic code and dependencies

## 1.1.0.0
- Added plugin enable/disable toggle
- Auto-delete toggle now grayed out when plugin is disabled
- Added documentation about image history interaction
- Improved UI with warning about image history trade-offs

## 1.0.0.0
- Active image writer implementation
- Multi-format support (FITS, XISF, TIFF)
- Auto-delete CR3/CR2 toggle
- Full compression settings integration
- Profile-based settings persistence
